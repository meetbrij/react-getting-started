# Getting Started with React

## Setting up React workflow - tools you would need
- babel.js transpiler: it takes your code written in a ECMAScript 2015 and produces code that older browsers can support and run. It also has a built-in JSX transpiler. It can take JSX syntax that React uses and produce the JavaScript code out of it. Babel.js is widely adopted solution for transpiling your code.
- Webpack module bundler:
- Gulp (build system and task runner)
- npm (package manager)
- Bower (package manager)
- Mocha (test framework)
- Jasmine (library for testing)
- ESLint (code linter for ECMAScript 2015)
- Yeoman (scaffolding tool)
